**Solobarine/Solobarine** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my past projects and I will be happy to help.
- ğŸ“« Reach me via my social media handles: [LinkedIn] | [email](wwww.solobarine@gmail.com)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love swimming, just not in water.
