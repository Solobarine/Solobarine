## 👋 Hey there, I'm Solomon Akpuru!

### 🚀 Full Stack Developer | JavaScript Enthusiast | Tech Explorer

🌐 Crafting interactive and user-centric web applications is my passion. With expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies, I bring ideas to life with seamless functionality and elegant design.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

🔹 Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, PHP

🔹 Front-End: React, Vue.js, Redux, Pinia

🔹 Back-End: Express, Laravel, Ruby on Rails

🔹 Testing: Cypress, Jest, Capybara, RSpec

💡 I thrive on challenges and enjoy diving deep into complex problems. Whether it's creating dynamic user interfaces, architecting scalable APIs, or optimizing database performance, I'm up for the task.

🔧 Writing clean, efficient code is my forte, and I'm equally adept at testing it. My PHP and Ruby skills allow me to ensure rock-solid functionality, and I'm familiar with testing frameworks like Cypress, Jest, Capybara, and RSpec.

📚 Outside of coding, I'm an avid reader of tech trends, always staying updated with the latest developments. When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me on the basketball court, perfecting my jump shot.
